1. Name Resolution

Python name resolution is odd. It is flow sensitive.
Rather than implement it as flow sensitive, I will convert it
to static and produce a warning.

2. True Testing (from python.org) 

Truth Value Testing

Any object can be tested for truth value, for use in an if or while condition or as operand of the Boolean operations below. The following values are considered false:

    * None

    * False

    * zero of any numeric type, for example, 0, 0L, 0.0, 0j.

    * any empty sequence, for example, '', (), [].

    * any empty mapping, for example, {}.

    * instances of user-defined classes, if the class defines a __nonzero__() or __len__() method, when that method returns the integer zero or bool value False.3.1

All other values are considered true -- so objects of many types are always true.

Operations and built-in functions that have a Boolean result always return 0 or False for false and 1 or True for true, unless otherwise stated. (Important exception: the Boolean operations "or" and "and" always return one of their operands.) 

3. Dynamism

Classes can be defined under conditionals and are not visible until
the definitions have been encountered.  This is likely something which
will not survive compilation.

Variables and bindings an be deleted.  Again, it is unlikely that this
behavior will survive compilation.
