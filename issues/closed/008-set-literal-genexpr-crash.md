# Issue 008: Set literals and generator expressions crash the compiler

**Status:** CLOSED 2026-07-20. Set literals and set comprehensions
fixed 2026-07-03 (`04a85584`/`f67cf692`). Generator expressions
originally got only an interim clean `fail()` (turning the crash
into a diagnostic, per this issue's own fix sketch); FIXED for real
2026-07-18 (`20fdc72d`, see [025](../025-shedskin-examples-coverage.md)'s
"Generator expressions implemented" entry) -- eagerly materializes
into a `list`, not a true lazy iterator (`yield`-backed laziness,
issue 014, was deliberately not used; no corpus usage found that
needs it). Revisit with real laziness if that changes; until then
there is no remaining work item against *this* issue.
**Affects:** `python_ifa_build_if1.cc` (`build_syms_pyda`'s and
`build_if1_pyda`'s `PY_set` cases — new; `PY_genexpr` given its own
`fail()` instead of falling into the shared no-op default, later
replaced with a real lowering — see "What landed");
`__pyc__/08_set.py` — new `set`/`__set_iter__` classes;
`python_ifa_build_if1.cc`'s `PY_compare` — fixed a pre-existing
`x in y` / `x not in y` operand-order bug found while wiring up
`set.__contains__` (see "What landed").
**Related:** [009](009-dict-comprehension-drops-comp-for.md) (dict
comprehensions — same family of gap, different failure mode; shared
this issue's loop-lowering machinery, closed the same way);
[017](017-multi-instance-mutation-corruption.md) (closed) — filed
after this fix exposed a serious pre-existing multi-instance data
corruption bug (affects `dict` too, nothing to do with sets
specifically), then fixed in a follow-up pass.

## Symptom

Both a set literal and a generator expression abort the compiler
process with an internal assertion — not a clean diagnostic:

```python
s = {1, 2, 3}
print(len(s))
```

```
pyc: if1/if1.cc:171: Code *if1_move(IF1 *, Code **, Sym *, Sym *, IFAAST *):
Assertion `a && b && a != b' failed.
Aborted (core dumped)
```

```python
g = (x * 2 for x in [1, 2, 3])
for v in g:
    print(v)
```

produces the identical crash and backtrace shape.

A set *comprehension* (`{x for x in y}`) hits the same assertion
(see issue 009 for the broader comprehension write-up).

## Root cause

`PY_set` and `PY_genexpr` are listed among the "nodes handled by
recursing into children with no special codegen" fallthrough in
`build_if1_pyda`:

```cpp
case PY_set:
case PY_genexpr:
case PY_yield_expr:
case PY_slice:
case PY_subscriptlist:
case PY_dotted_name:
case PY_dotted_as_name:
case PY_import_as_name:
default:
  for (auto c : n->children.values()) build_if1_pyda(c, ctx);
  return 0;
```

Unlike `PY_list`, `PY_tuple`, and `PY_dict` (each of which has its
own case above this, allocating a container and calling
`__setitem__`/append equivalents), `PY_set` and `PY_genexpr` never
allocate a result Sym (`ast->rval` is left null) — the code just
recurses into the element expressions and returns. Whatever
enclosing construct then tries to `if1_move` this AST's
(nonexistent) `rval` into a destination Sym hits
`assert(a && b && a != b)` with `a` (or `b`) null, because nothing
upstream ever produced a value for the set/genexpr node.

## Proposed fix sketch

1. **Set literals** — mirror the existing `PY_list`/`PY_tuple`
   case shape: allocate via the `set` builtin class (add if
   missing to `__pyc__/`), then call `__pyc_add__`/`add`-equivalent
   for each element expression, same pattern already used for
   `PY_dict`'s `__setitem__` loop just below it in the same
   function.
2. **Generator expressions** — these are more involved: a genexpr
   needs to become an actual lazily-evaluated iterator object
   (likely reusing whatever mechanism eventually backs `yield`,
   see issue 014), not just an eagerly-materialized list. If full
   laziness is out of scope initially, consider an explicit
   `fail("generator expressions not yet supported")` as an interim
   fix — turning the crash into a clean, testable diagnostic is
   strictly better even before the real feature lands.
3. Either way, the *immediate* actionable fix is: **stop letting
   these fall through to the no-op default case**. At minimum,
   add an explicit `fail(...)` for `PY_genexpr` so it degrades
   from "compiler crash" to "clean rejection" while the real
   fix is designed.

## What landed

1. **`__pyc__/08_set.py`**: a new `set`/`__set_iter__` pair, modeled
   directly on `07_dict.py`'s linear-scan-over-a-backing-list
   pattern (`_items`/`_len`, `self._items = self._items.append(x)`
   dedup-on-add). Implements `__len__`, `__contains__`, `add`,
   `discard`, `remove`, `pop`, `clear`, `__iter__`,
   `__pyc_to_bool__`, `__eq__`/`__ne__`, `__str__`.
2. **`build_syms_pyda`'s `PY_set` case**: resolves `ast->sym` to the
   `set` class (mirroring `PY_dict`), and — since `dictorsetmaker`
   gives the comprehension form `{expr for ...}` a 2-child shape
   (`[expr, PY_comp_for]`) distinct from the flat-literal N-child
   shape — gives the comprehension form its own scope, mirroring
   `PY_listcomp`/`PY_genexpr` just above it.
3. **`build_if1_pyda`'s `PY_set` case**: instantiates an empty `set`
   via a real constructor call (like `PY_dict`, since there's no
   low-level `sym_set` primitive the way `PY_list`/`PY_tuple` have);
   flat literals call `add()` per element; comprehensions reuse
   `build_list_comp_pyda` (the same loop-lowering machinery
   `PY_listcomp` uses), parameterized with a new `accum_method`
   argument so it calls `add()` instead of `sym_append`.
4. **`PY_genexpr`**: split out of the shared silent-recursion
   fallthrough into its own `fail("generator expressions not yet
   supported")` — the interim fix this issue's sketch proposed.
   **Superseded 2026-07-18** (`20fdc72d`, see issue 025's "Generator
   expressions implemented" entry): the `fail()` was replaced with
   the same three lines `PY_listcomp` uses (allocate an empty list,
   reuse the already-shared comprehension scope, call the existing
   `build_list_comp_pyda` loop-lowering helper) — genexprs now
   eagerly materialize into a `list` and produce real output rather
   than a clean rejection. `tests/genexpr_basic.py` is a live,
   passing test (not an `.expect_fail`) covering `sum`/`list`/`dict`/
   `join`/`sorted`/`any`/`all`/`min`/`max` consumers and nested/
   filtered forms.
5. **Fixed `x in y` / `x not in y`** (`PY_compare`): discovered while
   wiring up `2 in {1,2,3}` that the *existing* lowering called
   `lv.__contains__(rv)` (left operand as receiver) instead of the
   correct `rv.__contains__(lv)` — Python's `in` is asymmetric, the
   container (right operand) is always the receiver. Also dropped
   the fictitious `__ncontains__` dunder (`not in` doesn't have a
   separate protocol in real Python) in favor of `__contains__` +
   `__not__`, matching how `is not` is already lowered. This bug
   predated this issue and affected **every** container type
   (`list`, `dict`, `set`) — confirmed via `2 in [1,2,3]`, which was
   equally broken before this fix. Also implemented
   `list.__contains__` (`__pyc__/04_sequence.py`), previously a
   `pass` stub that silently returned `None` — invisible until the
   operand-order fix made it reachable.

Verified against real `python3` output (`tests/set_literal_basic.py`,
`tests/genexpr_basic.py` locks in the clean `fail()` via
`.expect_fail`): set literals, dedup, `in`/`not in`, iteration,
`str()`, comprehensions (plain and filtered), `add`/`discard`,
multiple concurrent instances. Passes on both the C and v2 LLVM
backends.

**While testing, found (and later fixed) issue 017**: constructing a
second instance of `dict` (or `set`) in the same function and
mutating it produced silently wrong values — nothing to do with sets
specifically (a minimal `dict`-only repro reproduced it identically).
It initially constrained how the new set tests could be composed
(each test kept mutation to a single instance, or kept multiple
instances read-only); once issue 017 was fixed, `tests/set_literal_basic.py`
was consolidated back into one natural test exercising several
concurrent instances (`s`, `dup`, `comp`, `evens`) plus mutation,
since the artificial isolation was no longer needed.

## Verification plan

1. `{1, 2, 3}` compiles and `len(s) == 3` at runtime. ✓
2. `(x * 2 for x in [1, 2, 3])` now runs and produces correct
   output, matching CPython (eager `list` materialization; real
   laziness would be tracked in issue 014 if ever needed). ✓
3. No `Assertion .* failed` / core dump for either construct. ✓
4. `tests/set_literal_basic.py` and `tests/genexpr_basic.py` added,
   both passing (the latter is a real executing test, not an
   `.expect_fail`). ✓

## What this unblocks

Set literals are common in idiomatic Python (deduplication,
membership tests) and now work correctly on both backends. Generator
expressions also now work (eager materialization) rather than merely
failing cleanly — true laziness remains a follow-on, tracked jointly
with issue 014, only if a corpus example is ever found that actually
needs it. The `in`/`not in` operator fix unblocks membership testing
for *any* container, not just sets.
