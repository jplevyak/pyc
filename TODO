- handle __path__ builtin
- modules (__all__ is the list of "public" names or names not starting with "_")
- import doesn't handle zip files
- dead code detection at at Var level
- import does lookup in the current package first
- import explicit relative imports (e.g. one of . .. ..Filters ) 

Support for C includes and external functions:

__c_include__("stdio.h")
argv = []
n = __c_function__("int GET_ARGC();")
ofor x in range(n):
  argv[x] = __c_function__("const char *GET_ARGV(int)", x)


MOSTLY DONE

- simple closure removal -- MOSTLY DONE
- constant propogation working in c_codegen and dead code elimination - MOSTLY DONE
