add_list should take element_type of the merge
implement setslice

change c_code to be c_call and make it always a call

add ability to use __pyc_rest__ to tag a symbol is_rest and add prim_rest to
destruct the rest of a tuple.

print should handle print "foo %d %s" % (1, "hi")

__done__ "#operator" __c_code__ to __pyc_done__ __pyc_operator__ __pyc_c_code__
- handle __path__ builtin
- modules (__all__ is the list of "public" names or names not starting with "_")
- import doesn't handle zip files
- dead code detection at at Var level
- import does lookup in the current package first
- import explicit relative imports (e.g. one of . .. ..Filters ) 
- call_method should know if it is global (in main) so as to call new_sym with
the global flag
- remove dead function members removed through static binding

Support for C includes and external functions:

__c_include__("stdio.h")
argv = []
n = __c_function__("int GET_ARGC();")
ofor x in range(n):
  argv[x] = __c_function__("const char *GET_ARGV(int)", x)


change __pyc_declare__ to use sym_unknown?
