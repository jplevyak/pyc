1. dead code test should be applied at the AVAR/ES level and then cloning
should be used to prune dead code in a call site specific way... it is possible
to even do this during analysis

Yah, have to go this route which means maintaining the AVars.

2. dead code should be detectd via flow through the AVars, paricularly to
handle weird bits ... or should it? maybe it is better to do it at the var level

-- need to figure out a way to edit those for simple inlining

dead_code detection should work at the Var level

of course that means after simple inlining the avars info is mangled.

humm...

... detect non-const non parameter arguments and bail out of simple ininling
...

make simple inlining optional
